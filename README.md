I made a personal website in two themes.

## Dark Version
https://www.ethanuong.com/dark
A dark theme that is more comprehensive than the light but isn't responsive. This version uses HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery.

## Light Version
https://www.ethanuong.com
A light theme in Bootstrap 4 and Angular 6. The idea behind this theme was inspired by "less is more." You will need Node.js and Angular CLI to get the modules and build.
