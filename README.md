http://etuong.com I made a personal website in two themes.

## Dark Version
A dark theme that is more comprehensive than the light but isn't responsive. This version uses HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery.

## Light Version
A light theme in Bootstrap 4 and Angular 6. The idea behind is theme was inspired by "less is more."
